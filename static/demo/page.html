								<b><i>San Jose, CA (2445 Fontaine Rd), Store #206/3001</i></b> also known as <b><i>Tully Road</i></b>, 
								is a <a href="#">Chuck E. Cheese</a> location that opened in December of 1981 with a 
								<a href="#">Balcony Stage</a>. This store is known for being the largest in the United States. 
								The building was formerly the Magic Village Toy Store before becoming a <a href="#">Pizza Time 
								Theatre</a>	in 1981. This one-of-a-kind location is also known for having a 30-foot Chuck E. Cheese 
								statue facing toward a neighboring road.
							</p>
							<h2>Stages</h2>
							<p>
								When the location opened, it housed a <a href="#">Cyberamics Balcony Stage</a> and then later,
								<a href="#">Chuck E.'s House Facade</a>. Lounge/Cabaret acts consisted of <a href="#">The King</a>,
								<a href="#">Dolli Dimples</a>, and <a href="#">The Beagles</a>. The Beagles were initially placed in
								a display window to entertain guests waiting in line to enter the building; in the mid-eighties they
								were moved inside the building on the first floor. All cabaret acts would be removed before 1991. This
								location also had two sets of <a href="#">Warblettes</a>: one rainbow, one black.
							</p>
							<p>
								Between 1993 and 1994, the Chuck E.'s House Facade was removed and the <a href="#">2-Stage</a> was
								installed. In 2001, the location received a <a href="#">Studio C Alpha</a>. As one of the last
								originals installed in a location, the Chuck E. Cheese animatronic received the "Cool Chuck" outfit.
								As for the <a href="#">Cyberamic</a> characters, the <a href="#">Chuck E. Cheese Cyberamic</a> was
								put on display at the front entrance of the store, while the other characters were either sold off
								or used for parts in different nearby locations.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the 2010s, the <a href="#">Interactive Console</a> and Blue Screen camera were removed. In December
								2018, the location was remodeled and received the <a href="#">Circles of Light</a>, then the largest
								in the chain. This was complimented with the <a href="#">Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor)</a> in May
								2022.
							</p>
							<h2>History</h2>
							<h3>Pizza Time Theatre</h3>
							<p>
								In 1974, the building opened as Magic Village Toy Store. It featured three giant toy soldiers enclosed 
								in giant display windows. It gained a reputation for being such a large toy store. A local legend about 
								the store told that a girl tragically once died from falling from the store's third floor. Locals said 
								that the ghost of the girl haunts the building to this day <a href=#><sup>[1]</sup></a>. It went out of 
								business sometime in the 1970s and briefly became a discotheque before reopening as a PTT in 1981. The 
								location had a vast kiddie area, being one of the few locations to feature Chuck E.'s Play N' Place and 
								a large under-the-sea themed ball-pit area that featured Chuck E. Cheese's Tinker Towers.
							</p>
							<h4>Chuck E. Cheese Statue</h4>
							<p>
								When the location was still Magic Village, it had three giant toy soldiers enclosed in illuminated windows 
								facing toward Tully Rd. These were later salvaged and sent back to the original owner before closing. 
								Having three empty windows, Nolan Bushnell wanted a large Chuck E. Cheese statue to be placed inside one of 
								these windows. Before the location opened, artist Jeff Tritel was commissioned to create the 30-foot statue. 
								A smaller bronze desktop prototype was also created for PTT executives. Because Tritel was alone creating 
								the statue, he had to work all day and night. Tritel even had to sleep inside the store to meet ends meet. 
								The finished statue was of Chuck E. Cheese sitting on a large block of cheese holding a microphone in one 
								hand and waving the other. In the mid-eighties it was discovered that a homeless person was living inside 
								of the cheese the Chuck E. sits on. When he left one morning the door was secured, his blankets are still 
								within the wooden base. The statue's checker vest was changed to his red vest version, the block of cheese 
								was changed to purple, and the microphone was removed. The base would be changed to green in the 2000s.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p class="quote">
									About twenty five years ago I visited the Pizza Time Theatre (Chuck E. Cheese started out as Pizza Time 
									Theatre) corporate offices looking for work. I had heard that they were working with audio animatronic 
									characters and I thought that I might fit in with their design and engineering staff. Armed with my 
									sculpture portfolio I was brought before their lead engineer and after a brief interview was told that 
									I didn't have the skill set to be a member of his team. However, Pizza Time Theatre had just purchased 
									a new building to be used as a restaurant and training facility and it so happened that on the outside 
									of this building there was (and still is) a 40 foot tall, semi-circular window. The next thing I knew I 
									was sitting down with Nolan Bushnell and the Pizza Time executives and they were asking if I would like 
									to build a 30-foot-tall Chuck E. Cheese for their new building! Never having done anything on this scale 
									before, my answer was a resounding, “SURE, I can do it!” I actually had no idea how; I'd figure that out 
									later. Six months and 5,000 pounds of polyurethane foam and fiberglass later, I had the dubious distinction 
									of building the largest pizza-eating rat in the world along with 8 bronze desktop versions for Nolan and 
									his executives.
								</p>
								<p class="quote_attr">Jeff Tritel <a href=#><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
							</blockquote>
							<h4>Training Center & Test Kitchen / CEC University</h4>
							<p>
								Shortly after opening, the store would be the exclusive host of the <a href="#">PTT Training Center & Test
								Kitchen</a> program. This would be held on the third floor employee-only area for training employees from 
								other locations as well as future store general managers. 'Hard down' repairs of games would be handled by 
								techs housed on the third floor as well. Trainees spent a week on the third floor learning all about the food 
								product, then spend a week working downstairs in the store. The test kitchen portion would allow Pizza Time 
								Theatre to standardize its menu lineup for 1982, alongside being able to test and refine future menu releases. 
								This program would end in 1984 with the merger of Showbiz Pizza Place and Pizza Time Theatre companies. The 
								location was sold and became a franchise so no further training was done there, though the carved "Chuck E. 
								University" wooden sign with Chuck wearing a robe and mortar board and holding a rolled certificate of graduation 
								remained mounted outside for a number of years. Corporate CEC asked for the sign, which was shipped to them, 
								never to be seen again. With no use for the area, it became a storage area. Plenty of historical items from the 
								location's history would be held here.
							</p>
							<h4>Disney's Cease & Desist</h4>
							<p>
								Around the restaurant were several unique murals. Some relocated from one of Pizza Time Theatre's costume 
								departments. One of these murals, "Royal Order of Rodents", featured characters outside of Pizza Time Theatre's 
								ownership. The most notable of these are Mickey and Minnie Mouse. On October 13, 1989, Someone took a photo and 
								sent it to Disney and they sent the location a cease and desist, causing them to remove the mural immediately 
								(Disney is known for their legal department). The mural was meant to be thrown away, but an employee hid it away 
								to prevent its destruction. During a remodel, the other murals were removed as well and hidden away by the same 
								employee. They are now displayed out of the public eye on the third floor with the cease and desist letter next 
								to the infamous mural <a href=#><sup>[3]</sup></a>.
							</p>
							<h3>Chuck E. Cheese's</h3>
							<p>
								Roughly around 1991, the location was remodeled into Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza as part of the <a href="#">1986 SPT 
								Remodel Program</a>. At this time, Fontaine also received customized multi-colored booths and interior décor. In 
								1992 the location is featured in two pieces of official media from Showbiz Pizza Time's Entertainment Department. 
								The first of which is a tape for employees that summited footage of various live performances <a href=#><sup>[4]
								</sup></a>. Then as part of SPT filming in California, they visited the Fontaine location to feature in "Little Red 
								Corvette" <a href=#><sup>[5]</sup></a>. In December 2000 the location became one of the last to receive a brand new 
								remodel from the <a href="#">1994 SPT Repositioning / Remodel Program</a>. When <a href="#">Skytubes</a> were 
								introduced to this location they originally cut through the wall above the 2-Stage, giving a top-down view of the 
								showroom for people inside, however In 2007 the Toddler Zone from <a href="#">Phase 3 (2000)</a> and the Skytubes 
								would be removed due to a guest lack of interest. In May 2007 fan convention Cheese-Vention 4 is held at this location. 
								Some of the posters, the Photo Ride car, and the store's Chuck E. bot would be added to the windows in front of the 
								store. In December 2018, Fontaine started their 2.0 remodel, being completed later in 2019. This would be the final 
								United States location to receive a <a href="#">Circles of Light</a> show. Some of the store's Phase 3 art would be left 
								there. Two Ticket Blasters would be placed in front of the COL stage. The store would get a 2021 Model Dance Floor on 
								March 2022. On March 26, 2023, the Chuck E. Cheese Cyberamic character was discovered to be on display at Revival 
								Collectibles in Grand Ledge, MI. The animatronic isn't for sale as of now. On December 24th, 2023, it was discovered that 
								the store began installation on a new elevator.
							</p>
							<h4>Store Number</h4>
							<p>
								According to chuckecheese.com, Fontaine Rd. was <b><i>Store #206</i></b> in 2009 <a href=#><sup>[6]</sup></a>. It was 
								renumbered to <b><i>Store #3001</i></b> when Corporate renumbered franchised stores to four-digit numbers in 2010. The 
								<b><i>#206</i></b> would be reused for the <a href="#">Valley Stream, NY (750 Sunrise Highway Suite 105)</a> location, 
								which opened on February 5, 2024.
							</p>
							<h3>COVID-19</h3>
							<p>
								During the Coronavirus pandemic, the location was closed for thirteen months and fears of it permanently closing were 
								high. The property was listed on LoopNet on October 16, 2020, but taken down at a later date. During this time, a hoax 
								was perpetrated saying that the location was to become a "gentleman's club." To keep the location afloat, the owner had 
								to sell items held inside the former CEC University center. This included signage, prototypes, and animatronic parts. (It 
								also included the Chuck E. animatronic inside the window.)
